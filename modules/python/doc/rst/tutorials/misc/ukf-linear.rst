Example on a linear case study on how to use Unscented Kalman filter
=======================================================================

This example shows how to use an Unscented Kalman filter in Python.

This example is a linear case study. It is not what is intended for the Unscented
Kalman filter, but it permits to get familiar with the different classes that
are used.

The state vector and measurements are explained in the  `C++ example <https://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-daily/ukf-linear-example_8cpp-example.html>`_.
